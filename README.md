# Eng-German-seq2seq-translator
Create an Eng-German BILSTM model that uses Bahadanu attention. (Learning Project) Will play around with different features such as layernorm, beamsearch and tokenization. 

Model will serve as a nice benchmark to a future transformer translator or fine Tuning a pretrained transformer.
